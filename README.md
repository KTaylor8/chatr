# Chatr
I was selected to participate as a student in the seven-week-long Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Adobe. For my final project, I collaborated with 3 other girls for 6 days to apply what we had learned in the past several weeks and create a prototype of a safe space website called Chatr (pronounced as "chatter") where girls can give and receive support female-oriented forums and view/post inspirational images.

Since the conclusion of Girls Who Code, I have continued building upon it a little, and that version can be found at [https://ktaylor8.github.io/chatr/index.html](https://ktaylor8.github.io/chatr/index.html). My edits have mainly concerned optimizing the post and comment functions of the chatroom and designing a more user-friendly interface. The original version of Chatr as it was when we finished GWC can be found [here](https://gwc-chatr.github.io./).
